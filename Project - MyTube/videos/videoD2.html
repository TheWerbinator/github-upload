  <p>The Tesla Model 3. It has disrupted the industry and built as much love as it has hate. I've lived with my Tesla Model 3 Performance for over a year now, and that time has left me with many impressions about the car. The Model 3 is wildly fast (0-60 in 3.2 seconds), smooth, quiet, and has excellent range for an electric car. Overall it makes for such an incredible driver, that even Koenigsegg himself claimed "It's the best contemporary 'normal' daily driver around." </p>
